### Markdown

The pages of this website are written in markdown. You will find a template [here](/docs/template.md).

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for:

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### HTML

Some elements have to be written in HTML, because markdown does not provide their functionalities.

e.g. page centered images:

```
<div style="text-align: center;">
  
  ![NAME](PATH/TO/IMAGE.png "NAME")
</div>
```
or Dropdown lists:
```
<details>
  <summary>[NAME]</summary>
</br>
  
  Content of the dropdown
</details>
```

### Jekyll Themes

This Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme.
