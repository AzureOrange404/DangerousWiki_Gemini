# Welcome

Welcome to the official Rick Dangerous Project Wiki.   
This wiki mainly functions as a guide for using the Never Ending Edition RetroPie image by Rick Dangerous.

## The Rick Dangerous Project

Rick Dangerous loved playing games on various systems since he was a little kid. When he got into emulation he became obsessed and even released his disk images to be downloaded.   
  
  The **Never Ending Edition** (NEE) is the newest creation by Rick Dangerous and it probably will be the last edition produced within this project.
  
  It is not completed yet and will recieve some updates. The Never Ending But Ended Edition will then again be available to download.
