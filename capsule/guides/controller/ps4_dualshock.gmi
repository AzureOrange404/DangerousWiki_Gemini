# How to pair and configure a PS4 DualShock Controller
_by @RickDangerous_

1. Enter the Bluetooth Devices Configuration menu.
2. Put the controller into pairing mode by pressing and holding the **Share Button** and then the **PS Button**  
After a few second, the light bar will strobe rapidly and brightly.
3. The controller is now in pairing mode and you proceed with following the on screen instructions.

## How to turn the controller off

The controller will not sleep on its own if left idle, it will remain on until the battery goes flat.

To force the controller to go to sleep, hold the PS button for 10 seconds.

Once the light bar turns off, the controller is asleep.
