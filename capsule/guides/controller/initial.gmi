# How to configure a controller on RetroPie's first boot  
_by @RickDangerous_

## On first boot

On first boot we need to setup a controller. This can be with a keyboard or other compatible gaming controller.  
My personal choice is to setup my keyboard on first boot.

1. Plug in your controller or keyboard, power you Raspberry Pi and boot into RetroPie,  
you will see the following welcome screen.

2. Hold down a button and you will enter the configuration menu.  
The controller configuring screen below shows us exactly what buttons to map.  
If a button is not registered or we press the wrong button, we can scroll up and
change the mapping for any specific button when we reach the bottom of the
configuring menu.  
You can also skip mapping buttons which your controller might not have by holding any already configured button to skip it.

3. Now I have my first controller setup I can now navigate emulation station and add more controllers.

If you wish to add a usb gaming controller or 2.4ghz wireless gaming
controller we can do that next by pressing start which opens up the main
menu and then by choosing configure input.
