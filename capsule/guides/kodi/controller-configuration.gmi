# Controller Configuration   
_by @AzureOrange_

Configuring a controller inside Kodi is fairly easy. Recommended for Kodi is any controller, that has the same layout as for example an XBox Controller. But despite this, any controller should work it just may not serve every function possible.

If you have not yet configured a controller for Kodi you may use a keyboard to go through the first steps.

1. Enter **Settings**
2. Enter **System**
3. Select **Input**
4. Select **Configure attached controllers**
5. If you use a controller with the same button layout as an XBox Controller:   
    5.1 choose **Kodi**   

    5.2 follow the mapping process as seen on screen   

    5.3 hit **OK**
6. If you use any other kind of controller:   
    6.1 Choose **Get more...** on the right   

    6.2 choose a controller, which matches the layout of yours, from the list   

    6.3 choose your newly added controller   

    6.4 follow the mapping process as seen on screen   

    6.5 hit **OK**

Your controller is now configured and ready to use.
