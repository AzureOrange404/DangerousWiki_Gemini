# Kodi   
_by @AzureOrange_

Kodi is a free and open source (FOSS) media player application, which is included in the Never Ending Edition RetroPie image by default. 

Using Kodi you may play almost anything from movies, music, photos located in the internet or locally on maybe a harddrive. By installing add-ons things like YouTube, Netflix, Plex, Jellyfin and lots more can be implemented and used through Kodi and with that through your RetroPie setup.

Inside the NeverEnding Edition Kodi is located next to Options in the EmulationStation Menu.

## Themes

The recommended Kodi skin (theme) to use within the Never Ending Edition is [Titan Bingie](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=355993), which provides a netflix-like look and feel and matches well with the RetroPie theme by @RickDangerous.

## Controller Configuration

Inside Kodi you again have to manually configure your controller as it does not access the same configs as RetroPie. Configuring a controller is fairly easy, assuming wireless controllers are already connected to your Pi via RetroPie.
