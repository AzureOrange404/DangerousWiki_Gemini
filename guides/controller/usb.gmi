# How to configure an additional USB controller   
_by @RickDangerous_

1. Plug in your controller or keyboard.

2. Press **start** on an already configured controller.

3. Choose "Configure Input"

4. Hold down a button and you will enter the configuration menu.  
The controller configuring screen shows exactly what buttons to map.  
If a button is not registered or a wrong one is pressed, you can scroll up and change the mapping for any specific button when you reach the bottom of the configuring menu.  
You can also skip mapping buttons which your controller might not have by holding any already configured button to skip it.

5. Done.
