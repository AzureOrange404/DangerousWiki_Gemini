# How to mess with Runcommand  
_by @RickDangerous_

Each time you load a Game there is an option to open what is called
the Runcommand Launch Menu.

## The Runcommand Launch Menu

1. This is accessed by pressing any button on a controller or kebyoard.
I usually use A or X depending on my controller.

Below is the launch screen for Arcade.

2. After pressing a button / key whilst loading a game you will be shown
a menu like below depending on the system you choose.

3. You are given several menu options of which four will be covered now:

* Select default emulator for arcade (lr-fbneo)  
Which ever emulator we choose with this option will be the main default emulator for the whole system.

* Select emulator for ROM  
We can choose which emulator we want for the current game we are loading. The change will get saved to the emulators.cfg.

* Select video mode for lr-fbneo  
This will allow you to set a custom resolution for the emulator.  
This change will get saved in videomodes.cfg

* Select video mode for lr-fbneo ROM  
This will allow you to set a custom resolution for the current game we are loading. This change will get saved in videomodes.cfg

## Disable the Launch Menu

The run command configuration is useful to disable the launch menu. You might wanâ€™t to do this to stop accidentally changing an emulator or video setting which might stop a game from launching. This is very useful if you have kids.

1. Navigate to the options screen.
