# Emulation Station Hotkeys
_by @RickDangerous_

## The Hotkey button

The Hotkey button enables you to press it in combination with another button to access functions such as saving, loading, and exiting in emulators.  
It is suggested to use the Select button as the hotkey. The following chart shows the default hotkey combinations. 

Note Hotkey combinations are specific to RetroArch / Libretro based emulators.

* Hotkey+Start:   Exit

* Hotkey+Left Shoulder:   Load
* Hotkey+Right:   Input State Slot Increase
* Hotkey+Left:   Input State Slot Decrease
* Hotkey+X:   RGUI Menu

## Game Focus

Pressing Scroll Lock on the keyboard disables any hotkeys and sends all input directly to the game being run. 

Press again to toggle back the hotkeys.

This is a really useful feature for some of the computer systems like ZX Spectrum as sometimes the hotkeys will stop you from being able to use certain butons or movements.
